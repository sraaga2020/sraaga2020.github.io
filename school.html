                                <p>
                                        I believe that traditional schooling is more enjoyable and effective than virtual schooling! I think this because traditional schooling enables students to learn in a more scheduled manner. Traditional schooling also lets students learn in an interactive way which is not as easy with virtual schooling. Perhaps, the most important reason why traditional schooling is better is, because it gives students an opportunity to learn a wider range of topics.


                                
                                
                                <p>I believe that traditional schooling is more enjoyable and effective than virtual schooling! I think this because traditional schooling enables students to learn in a more scheduled manner. Traditional schooling also lets students learn in an interactive way which is not as easy with virtual schooling. Perhaps, the most important reason why traditional schooling is better is, because it gives students an opportunity to learn a wider range of topics.
                                        schooling, students can  also learn at a pace that they are comfortable with by having one on one sessions with their teachers. They can also discuss the topic with their peers to confirm other doubts, which is not possible with virtual school. These are a few reasons why I think traditional schooling provides a more comfortable pace for students. 

                                    </p>
                                
                                <p>Another important reason why traditional schooling is more effective than virtual schooling is because it lets students learn in an interactive way. Students can learn to work with different people or by themselves. They can learn teamwork this way and also working independently. Students can also learn different methods of solving problems from peers and teachers. This can help because they could find out a method that might be much easier for them than the one they are used to. Students can learn from hands-on experiments and real life examples with traditional school. This can be helpful for students who are more comfortable with seeing a real-life example than imagining what would happen. These are the ways students can benefit from interactive learning. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>One more way traditional schooling can be more helpful to students is because it allows them to learn a wider range of topics. When attending a traditional school, students can learn from different people with different expertees. This is helpful because it is good for students to get different parts of their brain activated. It also allows students to participate in art and sports activities such as school teams and contests. Doing this can be fun for students so they can have some fun instead of only studying. Students can also attain more general knowledge from their peers through casual conversations. This will not happen often in virtual schooling because students donâ€™t meet their peers that often. Traditional schooling can teach students things that they might not have known with virtual schooling. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>These are just a few ways why I think traditional schooling weighs over virtual schooling. Students can learn without distraction in a scheduled manner. Traditional schooling also allows students to learn in a fun, interactive way, which is much harder to do with virtual schooling. The most important reason why I think traditional schooling is more effective though, is because it allows students to learn a wider range of topics, in and outside the educational environment. What is your opinion on schooling now?
