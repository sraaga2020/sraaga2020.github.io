<h3>HISTORY OF THE COTTON GIN</h3>

The cotton gin, invented in 1793 by Eli Whitney, was one of the most important and useful innovations in the Industrial Revolution. It changed lives, slavery, and history. The Industrial Revolution was a time period in which most of the world's greatest innventions took place. It began in Britain in the mid-18th century. 

<h3>WHAT IS THE COTTON GIN, AND HOW DID IT CHANGE THE WORLD?</h3>

Ok, well what is the cotton gin? It might seem surprising, but the cotton gin is actually a machine that cleans cotton. That's pretty weird right, one of the world's greatest machines processes cotton? In the 1800s though, that was a big thing. Before the cotton gin was invented, African American slaves had to pick out cotton seeds and dust from cotton with their hands! That must have been tiring! Since using that method was slow and could only produce a limited amount of cleaned cotton, more slaves were used. With the cotton gin, slaves could clean 50 times more cotton than they could by hand. So, now slaves can clean more cotton each day, which means that the number of slaves would be reduced, right? Sadly, it didn't work out that way. After people started learning about the cotton gin, the demand for cotton soared. Now, there had to be more slaves to pick the cotton and to clean the cotton. In conclusion, the cotton gin effected many people's lives, in both positive and negative ways. 

<h3>HOW DOES THE COTTON GIN WORK?</h3>

The design of the gin was very simple. There are two rotating brushes, mounted in a box, that pull the cotton fibers, or lint, through small slots, separating the fibers from seeds. The brushes were turned by a hand crank.


<h3>ELI WHITNEY</h3>

Eli Whiteney was the young inventor who designed the cotton gin. Eli was born in 1765. In 1792 he graduated from Yale college. In 1793 Eli designed the revolutionary cotton gin. In 1794, one year after he designed it, he got a patent for the design of the gin, which meant that he owned the rights to the idea of the gin. In 1825 Eli Whitney died at the age of 59. -S
