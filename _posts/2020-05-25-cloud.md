# Bubble Cloud Express
 <img src="/images/bubblegum.jpg" width="300">
Lauren walked across the baseball diamond, and plopped down on her favorite bench.” I’m going to try to beat my bubblegum blowing record from last month. It’s pretty sunny anyway so the wind won’t make my bubble won’t pop.” Lauren thought as she fished in her pocket for a new stash of bubble gum. “Aha!” Lauren exclaimed, when she found the one she was looking for. She took out the whole pack and chewed on it until it was soft. Then she stretched it across her tongue, took a deep breath, and blew a bubble until it was as big as her hand. then her head. then her stomach. then her body! All of a sudden a big gust of wind rocked Lauren backwards. I won’t stop blowing even if I get carried away! Lauren thought, stubbornly.
And that’s exactly what happened, dear readers.(Tip: Never think of something like that because it will happen). Then her bubble started getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger until it was bigger than Lauren! The bubble enclosed around her like a hamster ball and felt as hard as wood. Umm, What is happening?! Lauren thought. Then a screen with a speaker attached to the bottom of it, popped up to the left of her. “Hello, Lauren! We have been waiting for so long! Welcome to Bubble Cloud Express, you are currently floating in a trunk Bubble Cloud. If you would like to upgrade your seat or if you have any questions, please press the red button below the screen and speak. We hope you have a good ride!” a jolly voice said. Trunk! What a low class level, I have to upgrade! Lauren thought since she always wanted to have the best option possible. So Lauren pressed the red button. Beep! “Hello, Lauren how can we help you?”
“How do you know my name?” she asked.
“Well you know, it’s just things that blipes know.”
“What? Who are blipes?”
“Ahem, ahem ME!”
“Whatever! Anyway how do I upgrade my seat? And how do I get food and drinks, I’m starving!” Lauren asked thinking this was kind of like a flight, and not realizing how this possibly could be happening.
“Well, for your first question you will see on the screen the upgrading menu and the cost. For your second question if you upgrade to the Premium Blipe option, you will get your free inflight meal and drinks.”
Lauren looked back to the screen and there were really different comfort options. It read: Trunk for 0 blippees, Deluxe for 100 blippees, and Premium Blipe for 250 blippees. Without thinking Lauren chose the Premium Blipe option. It listed all the things you would get if you choose Premium Blipe. Comfort, food, clothes, free wifi, ect......
What Lauren did not know is that, in the Bubble Cloud Express, if you buy something that costs more than how many ever blippees you have in your bank account you have to take a Blipe loan. Lauren did not have a BBA (Blipe Bank Account) so she didn’t have any blippees. The police officers started getting worried. Lauren did not have enough money to buy the Premium Blipe. She didn’t even have a Blipe bank account!  What would they do? In Bubble Cloud Express, it is forbidden to not give anyone what they want, even if they don’t have enough money. If Lauren was a regular blipe, they would have just marked the amount of money she should have paid and subtracted it from her bank account, or they would have given her a loan statement. But, Laruen didn’t even have a bank account!!!!!!
All this time Lauren was getting bored. I already clicked the Premium Blipe. When is the food going to come? She thought. Then after what seemed like forever the ocers made a decision. Lauren would take the test like all humans who entered the Express! Oh, sorry I forgot to tell you what it is. It has 2 rooms, each room has obstacles or an obstacle you have to pass, and to complete the test successfully you have to finish at least 2 obstacles, sometimes you don’t know when one room starts and the other ends. and if you think you aren’t going to make it, then you can press an emergency button that magically gets you to safety but, if you press that button then you would fail the test.
The jolly voice repeated this to Lauren, but she was only kind of shocked since her mind was still on food. Then, suddenly a hole opened up under Lauren and she fell down onto a trampoline.
“Welcome to the test” a big banner above her said. Lauren slowly got on the trampoline and looked around her. She was in a small, completely white room. A few feet ahead she saw large double doors with a lever beside it. She walked towards it and tried to push it open but it wouldn’t budge. Then she tried pulling the lever down, as soon as she did that, a screen appeared in front of her. “Hello, Lauren,” a robotic voice said. “The test has begun, you will get one minute to prepare and then after that minute a hole will open up underneath you and you will get a soft landing into the first room.” I wonder where my emergency button is, she said aloud.”Oh, here you go.” the robotic voice said, startling Lauren. Then magically, a red ball with a built in button popped up in Lauren’s pocket.”5, 4, 3, 2, 1, BLASTOFF!” the voice counted down as Lauren, feet first plunged into a chasm.
She landed inside an white room, yeah again, and a white floor. So much for soft landings Lauren thought as she rubbed her bruised bottom. An electrical sign popped up underneath Lauren. It read: “Hello, your first obstacle is the Rod.” She looked ahead and started the test.
The first obstacle was an iron rod that was about 4 inches wide and about 4 yards long. Beneath the rod was a stinky pool of broccoli, cheddar creme! The rod was laid at a 45 degree angle and if you looked down from the height it was placed at it, the sight made you nauseous. Lauren, (after much arguing between the two halves of her brain) decided she wouldn’t look down. She used that solution, and even though she wobbled a few times, and she safely made it across.
The next obstacle had a tire and a set of monkey bars above it. There was a 30 foot long strip in front of the tire. You were supposed to walk on the tire to the end of the strip. The monkey bars were there for balance. Lauren grasped the first rung of the bars and gingerly stepped on the tire. She carefully walked forward, then let go of one hand and put it on the next bar, she wobbled a few times but made it safely across to the ending platform.
The third obstacle was the hardest so far. There was a rope, two treadmills, both of them rolling the opposite way you were supposed to go, and a foam octagon adrift the soup. The rope was laid horizontally (powered by extremely strong air coming from underneath the course), above the soup. You tightrope walk except your hands hold the rope and your legs dangle beneath you as you progress forward. When you reach the end of the rope, the treadmills would be a foot in front of you and a few inches underneath. Then you jump forward and land on the treadmills. The treadmills would stop for a few seconds after you landed on them, then they would start back up again. Lauren stared at the obstacles and wondered how she would do this. She was never good at sports or anything that involved athleticness. She was always clumsy, could never run fast, or couldn’t jump that far. She carefully grasped the rope with one hand and let one leg go to the platform. Then, with shaky hands, I mean a shaky hand she grasped the rope, now even if she wanted to she couldn’t turn back. She swung her legs back and forth to get momentum and jumped. Her feet raked the surface, but then she lost her balance and started falling! Then Lauren’s instincts told her to stretch her arms out and hold the end of the treadmill farthest to her and pull her body up. She did that, and it worked, but just enough so she could get a hold! With much cursing, she jumped onto the other treadmill and finished the test! She jumped down on the landing platform and walked forward, towards a portal. What? Where does this lead? Does it bring me back home? I guess there is only one way to find out! Lauren thought as she braced herself to jump in. At the last second Lauren thought, What if this leads back to the Bubble Cloud Express? Well what am I going to do stuck in the thing, anyways? I guess I’ll jump in, but next time Lauren thought, dawning on the truth, I shouldn’t be so greedy and choose the highest option, but I preferably want to go back home! She jumped in the portal, and found herself right there!
