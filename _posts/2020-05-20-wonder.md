# Wonder Book Review

Wonder is a unique and inspiring book that conveys a powerful message. This book is about a boy named August Pullman who has facial difficulties that keep him from doing things that most normal kids do. When he is ten, Auggie's parents decide that he should start going to a real school instead of being homeschooled by his mom. Auggie disgraces the idea, but his parents think it is time for him to experience the world where everyone is different. Over his school year, everyone around Auggie learns acceptance, compassion, and kindness. Auggie goes through tough times, but in the end he learns that you can't blend in when you were born to stand out.
