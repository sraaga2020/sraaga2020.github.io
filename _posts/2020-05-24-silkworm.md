excerpt: "I don't really think of silkworms that much, and I don't think you do either. But, when we do, we think of a fully developed white worm that produces silk. It might sound surprising, but the fully developed version of a silkworm is actually a white moth! Continue reading to learn more about the not so obvious life cycle of a silkworm!"

# Life Cycle Of A Silkworm

<h2>Stage 1: Eggs</h2>
<img src="/images/silk_eggs.jpg" width= "300"/>
The egg is in the first stage in the life cycle of a silkworm. Silkworms need warmth to hatch, so 
the female moth, after mating, lays her eggs during the end of summer. Silkworm eggs are tiny and have a solid structure resembling a poppy seed. Inside this protective eggshell, the embryonic development takes place. The eggs of a silkworm look light yellow, once laid. After the embryonic development is completed, it darkens to a bluish-grey. The eggs do not hatch until spring, next year. Warmth is needed to trigger the hatching of silkworm eggs. If the area where the moth laid her eggs is warm enough, the eggs will hatch in around ten days. Once the eggs hatch, tiny silkworms covered in black hair emerge out of it. These small worms immediately start chewing on tender mulberry leaves once they hatch. Female moths lay 200-500 eggs at once. It usually takes 24 hours for the egg laying process to finish. Mating and egg laying happen in the final stages of a silkworm moth. During this phase, the moth does not eat or drink, and eventually dies.
<h2>Stage 2: Larve</h2>

The larva is the second stage in the life cycle of a silkworm moth and lasts about 25–30 days. The silkworm, right after hatching, is about an eight of an inch and is incredibly hairy. These tiny worms pass through four molts between these 25-30 days. The period between two successful molts is called an instar. A silkworm’s head will turn a little bit darker than the rest of its body, before its first molt. As silkworms pass through these four molts, they start eating larger leaves. After each molt, these larvae sleep for 1-2 days before undergoing ecdysis (the process of shedding older skin). These four stages are called the four ages. Among the four molts, the first one is the stage that forms the distinctive features of silkworms. Following the first molt, the hard skin and hair on the worms shed and they transform into a caterpillar with soft, white skin. The larva of a silkworm develops the horn at the back of its body, following the first molt. During the first and second stages, the larvae feed on tender mulberry leaves, starting from the back, leaving nothing but the veins. Silkworms at stage three eat continuously to gain weight; by the time it is at stage four it will be fat and fluffy. Once they reach stage four, these worms can move around freely and start eating leaves from the edges, they also start eating the veins. It is in the fourth stage, that the silk gland in the silkworm’s chest fills with fibroin from the amino acids in the mulberry leaves. The fourth stage is the last stage of the larval stage. These fully developed larvae stop feeding on the leaves and start weaving threads of silk around themselves, forming a cocoon. This phase is the beginning of the third phase in their life cycle.
<h2>Stage 3: Pupa</h2>

The pupa is the third stage in the life cycle of a silkworm moth. After the fourth molt, the silkworm appears slightly yellow and its skin becomes tighter than it was in the previous stages. During this phase, the larva spins a cocoon of silk fiber around itself as a protective case. The larva sheds one more time in this protective envelope of silk in order to become a pupa, which is lean when compared to a larva. Inside this protective cocoon, the larva undergoes metamorphosis to become a fully developed silkworm moth. A silkworm can weave threads that measure up to 1.5 kilometers as single threads. The color of the silk filament may vary with the diet of the larva and seasonal influences. A pupa inside the hardened cocoon undergoes metamorphosis to transform into a fully developed winged silkworm moth slowly. The development of the distinct morphological features happens in the following order.
1. Transformation of the larvae into a pupa with hairy legs
2. Formation of a pair of compound eyes
3. Development of a couple of wings on either side of the chest
4. Formation of moth legs underneath the wings
Once fully developed into a moth, it secretes a yellow liquid called the lytic enzyme from its mouth which makes a hole in the protective cocoon shell. Through this hole, the fully developed moth finds its way out into the world.
<h2>Stage 4: Silkworm Moth</h2>

Becoming a silkworm moth is the last stage in the life cycle of a silkworm. These moths are hairy and have a wingspan of 55mm in general. The male moths are smaller than the female moths. Even though they have wings, silkworm moths are not capable of flying. They also lack functional mouthparts and hence, are unable to consume food. Silkworm moths’ compound eyes are as useless as their pair of wings. To make up for their poor eyesight, female moths secrete hormones that attract their potential mate. The male moth picks up the signal, and follows it all the way to the female moth, and they mate. A healthy female moth can produce up to 500 eggs.
