 <h3> <strong>What <em>is</em> Diwali?</strong> </h3>
    <br> 
    <p>Diwali is the festival of lights! 
         It is celebrated to ward off the evil. There are many others reasons 
         people celebrate Diwali, though. People in different places celebrate
         in different ways. My family celebrates Diwali like many others
         in Andhra Pradesh, India where my parents grew up. </p>
    <br>
    <h3><strong>Why <em>do</em> we celebrate Diwali?</strong></h3>
    <br>
    <p>As I said before, there are many reasons to clebrate Diwali, 
         but the main reason is to scare away the evil and bring in light. 
         Diwlai is a really fun festival!</p>
    <br>
   <h3><strong>How does <em>everyone</em> celebrate Diwali?</strong></h3> 
    <br>
    <p>The one thing that <em>everyone</em> does for Diwali is burn
      firecrackers and/or sparklers! They do it when it gets dark, since 
      dark is believed to be the domain of the evil. Many people also light
      <em>diyas</em>, which are small clay lamps that are filled with oil
      and and a small thread, they light this thread with a matchstick. They decorate these <em>diyas</em>
      and put them around and/or outside their house. They also do a pooja
      before eating in the morning to the goddess, Laxmi(Hindhu goddess 
      of wealth) to give wealth and prosterity. A pooja is a prayer ritual
      performed before you break your fast by Hindus to offer devotional worship
      to one or more dieties, to host and honor a guest, or to spiritually celebrate an event.
      Some people celebrate Diwali for more than one day. They do a pooja every day in the 
      week of Diwali. Diwali is an important festival for many people.</p>
     <br>
     <h3><strong>How does <em>my family</em> celebrate Diwali?</strong></h3>
     <br>
     <p>My family does firecrackers and sparklers like evryone else, too. We do a pooja and offer sweets and food to the gods 
         But, we do onion bombs, flower pots, sparklers, and firecrackers that
         spin on the floor! My mom makes special  homemade foods such as pulihora(lemon rice) and buys tasty sweets such as kaju katli(marzipan cut into diamond shapes). We usually invite or go to a friend's house 
         to celebrate. My favorite part of Diwali though, is spending time with my family. 
         Every year, we look at photos from the previous year's Diwali, and take photos that we would 
         look at next year. Celebrating Diwali is super fun!</p>
     <br>
   <h3>I'm sure my favorite holiday will <em>always be Diwali!</em></h3>
     <p>We all celebrate Diwali to ward off the evil. Everyone celebrates Diwali with firecrackers and 
         sparklers. When I celebrate Diwali with my family, my favorite part is spending time 
         together. i hope next year's Diwali will be as fun as every other one!</p></p>
