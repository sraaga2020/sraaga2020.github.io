					<h1>Why Mars?</h1>

				<p>I'm sure you all know by now about the craze to go to Mars and maybe even live there in the future. Have you
					ever thought, why <em>Mars</em>, why not the Moon, or Venus? The most obvious reason is probably that Mars is the
					closest <em>planet</em> to us. But, most importantly, scientific studies show that Mars is the planet that is most
					like ours in this solar system. It has an atmosphere, which is necessary for human beings to live (it's atmosphere
					has started becoming thinner from when Earth's population started increasing, though). Scientists were also able
					to observe that there was once water in the Red Planet, as they look at pictures and samples of the planet's
					landscape. Water is still stored in Mars, as the form of ice, along with frozen carbon dioxide. Another important
					fact that supports the opinion of living on Mars is that the planet is in the "Goldilocks Zone" of our solar
					system, meaning that it is close enough to the Sun to keep water liquid and sustain life, but also far enough from
					the Sun to avoid being scorched. This zone contains the only planets that life is possible on. The weather of
					these planets are not too hot, or too cold. We also have to think in the future to understand this Mars craze. As
					you know,the Earth is getting more polluted everyday with greenhouse gases, which is causing our atmosphere to get
					thinner and even form holes in some places. This is a bigger danger than you might think because the reason for
					our atmosphere is to protect us from the harmful rays the sun produces (and to protect us from objects from space
					falling on the Earth and making human pancakes). As our atmosphere gets thinner, we are more exposed to these rays
					which cause skin diseases and other health issues. Scientists predict that humans cannot live on Earth forever
					because of this reason, and need to find another planet suitable for hosting life. Mars meets these requirements
					and is therefore, one of the few, if not only possible planet to live on other than Earth. -<em>S</em>
