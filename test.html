<p>Do you support school uniforms, I do! 
    School uniforms are helpful and important in many ways. 
    Uniforms make it easier to get ready for school in the morning, 
    improve focus and discipline, and create equality for students.</p>
<br>
<p>One good reason to wear school uniforms is that they make it much easier to get ready in the morning!
    Students can quickly put on their uniforms and get to school on time without worrying about what to wear. 
    No worrying about where your favorite shirt or jacket is now! With uniforms, 
    time in the morning can be utilized for better things than choosing clothes. 
    Students can review their homework, prepare for a test, or pack their backpack. 
    Also, students don’t have to check whether their clothes match the dress code or not. 
    Uniforms always agree with the school rules!</p>

<p>School uniforms help promote focus and discipline on education, rather than fashion. 
    Students don’t have to maintain a certain style or trend, and can stay focused on important things such as studies.
     With the deviation of maintaining a trend, students will forget their priorities and become unfocused.
      With a disciplined attitude toward academics, students don’t have to find popularity with style.
       Once again, without this distraction students can focus on other academic aspects of the learning environment. 
       School uniforms mean that students can retain the information learned rather than letting go through one ear and out the other. 
       Learning and focusing on information learned is a good habit that can lead to better grades.</p>
<br>
<p>The most important reason school uniforms are important is because they create equality and reduce peer-pressure. 
    Uniforms make everyone wear the exact same or similar clothes. With this rule, there is less of a socioeconomic 
    distinction that can be made between students. There is a reduced level of peer-pressure to wear certain fashion 
    styles or purchase specific brands. Some gangs or cliques wear the same color or brands, to separate themselves 
    from everyone else, with uniforms this is not possible. With uniforms, students can build more friendships 
    through genuine networking skills rather than through popularity. Without a uniform, kids will try to find 
    friends through what they are wearing or what their gang is wearing.</p>

<p>How do you feel about uniforms now? I am more than sure that we need school uniforms because, 
    (a) they make it easier to get ready for school
    (b) they help promote focus and discipline
     (c) they create equality! Three cheers for school uniforms!
